## Overview

`ram-dl` is a tool that allows you to **upload** and **download** RAM to/from your system. Well, sort of :P

It is mostly intended as a tech demo for [r3map](https://github.com/pojntfx/r3map), a library for efficient distributed `mmap` with mounting and migration support, and [go-nbd](https://github.com/pojntfx/go-nbd), a pure Go NBD server and client library. Despite this it can however also be of use for a few experimental use cases, such as:

- **Extending a system's memory capacity over the network**: By leveraging the fast [fRPC](https://frpc.io/) RPC framework, you can use `ram-dl` and `ram-ul` to expand your local system's RAM (effectively **"downloading RAM"**) without having to use local disk space or memory.
- **Mounting a remote system's memory**: By allocating a memory region with `ram-ul` (effectively **"uploading RAM"**), it is possible to mount a remote system's RAM to your local system with minimal latency.
- **Getting insights into memory usage and contents**: By inspecting the "downloaded"/mounted memory with `ram-ul`, you can get insights into the contents of a remote system's memory.

`ram-dl` achieves this by essentially doing the following:

1. Starting a `go-nbd` server _and_ client locally with r3map's [Direct Mount API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/r3map@main/pkg/mount)
2. Connecting the NBD _server_ to a remote fRPC backend provided by `ram-ul`
3. Calling `mkswap`, `swapon` and `swapoff`, which enables paging out to the block device provided by the NBD client and thus to the connected remote fRPC backend.

For most real-world use cases, using [r3map](https://github.com/pojntfx/r3map)'s [Managed Mount API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/r3map@main/pkg/mount) or [Migration API](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pojntfx/r3map@main/pkg/migration) directly is the better (and much faster) option, but if you just want to see the [Download More RAM](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/download-more-ram) meme implemented in real life, you've come to the right place!

## Installation

Static binaries are available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/ram-dl/releases).

On Linux, you can install them like so:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/ram-dl "https://github.com/pojntfx/ram-dl/releases/latest/download/ram-dl.linux-$(uname -m)"
$ curl -L -o /tmp/ram-ul "https://github.com/pojntfx/ram-dl/releases/latest/download/ram-ul.linux-$(uname -m)"
$ sudo install /tmp/ram-dl /usr/local/bin
$ sudo install /tmp/ram-ul /usr/local/bin
```

You can find binaries for more architectures on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/ram-dl/releases).

## Tutorial

> TL;DR: "Upload" RAM with `ram-ul`, "download" the RAM with `ram-dl`, done!

### 1. Upload RAM

On a remote (or local) system, first start `ram-ul`. This component exposes a memory region, file or directory as a fRPC server:

```shell
$ ram-ul --size 4294967296
2023/06/30 14:52:12 Listening on :1337
```

### 2. Download RAM

On your local system, start `ram-dl`. This will mount the remote system's exposed memory region, file or directory using fRPC and r3map as swap space, and umount it as soon as you interrupt the app:

```shell
$ sudo modprobe nbd
$ sudo ram-dl --raddr localhost:1337
2023/06/30 14:54:22 Connected to localhost:1337
2023/06/30 14:54:22 Ready on /dev/nbd0
```

This should give you an extra 4GB of local memory/swap space, without using up significant local memory (or disk space):

```shell
# Before
$ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            30Gi       7.9Gi       6.5Gi       721Mi        16Gi        21Gi
Swap:          8.0Gi          0B       8.0Gi

# After
$ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:            30Gi       7.9Gi       6.5Gi       717Mi        16Gi        21Gi
Swap:           11Gi          0B        11Gi
```

ðŸš€ **That's it!** We hope you have fun using `ram-dl`, and if you're interested in more like this, be sure to check out [r3map](https://github.com/pojntfx/r3map)!
